# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my first devblog post!
So far I have added the drag and drop functions, adding text and moving them. I have also started with the resizing but that is proving alot harder then anything else.
The code I used is very Java Script heavy. Thats why 
I have had some help from my trusted companion copilot but mostly when bugfixing because I try to minimize AI use. I have also gotten from help from the internet and websites like stackoverflow.
## Changes 
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:<br>
*Drag and drop functions* <br>
*Basic Styling*
## Features
âœ… Drag and drop    
âœ… Change text
<br>
